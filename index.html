        <p>
        	Hi there! I am Lennart, I have a Masters of Science in Engineering within the area of Media Technology. During the bachelor years Interactive Media had focus. During my Masters the focus went to Human Computer Interaction, Vizualisation and User Experience. During these years I have done projects involving Agile Development, Interaction Design, User centered studies and combining new technologies for innovative ways to interact.

    	<h3>Mad Sand<br>________</h3>
    	<p>#: Unity, Kinect, Augmented Reality, C#, Interaction Design</p>
    	<p>Mad Sand is a game taking augmented reality gaming to a new level, allowing you to shape a digital world in real time through a physical sandbox. The game is an asymmetric cooperative game, where one player (“the Sandmaker") shapes the sand landscape to help the other player (“the Penguin”) to collect sweets. Sweets can appear floating high up in the sky or deep beneath the earth, thus the Sandmaker must change the landscape so that the Penguin successfully can grab the sweets. To help the Sandmaker see what's going on an augmented reality experience is also provided through a projection of the game world onto the sand. <br><br>This project was a part of the Advanced graphics and interaction 2015 course at KTH.</p>

    	<h3>Other Room<br>________</h3>
    	<p>#: WebGL, Three.js, HTML, CSS</p>
    	<p>Other Room purpose was to build a meditative scene that users could project on a wall at home to create the illusion of a another room just beyond the wall. To avoid creating a stressing experience the interaction would consist only of sound, the scene slightly changing depending on the current volume. Thus the user could put on their favorite harmonic music and watch the assets of the other room sway to the gentle music. <br><br>This project was a part of the Advanced graphics and interaction 2015 course at KTH.</p>

    	<h3>Deadly Teddy<br>________</h3>
    	<p>#: Maya, Unity</p>
    	<p>Rayman meets darks souls meets grim fandango basically. Ex-Terminator with an AI mounted into just the head on a robot teddy bear body by his creator when opposed. The chip in Teddy’s head stops him from attacking the creator. Teddy’s quest is to remove the chip, regain his free will, destroy his creator and escape the lab he’s bound to.<br><br> In this project my team position was in models and animation. Deadly Teddy was the main project in the course Computer Game Design 2015 at KTH.</p>

    	<h3>Building Blocks<br>________</h3>
    	<p>#: Arduino, Sensors, pySerial, Interaction Design</p>
    	<p>We wanted to create toys with physical interaction for children 1-4 years old. Building blocks have long been a robust toy for children with little evolvement for so many years, so we decided to make an alternate version of them. To inspire creativity and curiousness the blocks will change colors depending on the height of the tower the children are building. To achieve each block has a multicolor LED and Bluetooth buit in, together with a pressure sensor and pySerial server this magic was possible. <br><br> This project was part of the Physical Interaction course 2015 at KTH.</p>
