        <h3>About me - Now<br>________</h3>
        <p>#: Designer, Programmer, User centered experience, Master in HCI, Techie, Hobby Photographer, Geek, Semi-casual Gamer </p>
        <p>
        	Hi there! I'm Lennart, currently working within the Game & Tech industry as a UX Designer. Also having skills in programming so it is not unusual for me to give a go with that too, but that is mostly during sparetime or for side projects. You could say I'm a Jack of All trades but with a focus on User Experience and Development.
        	<br><br>
        	I have a Masters of Science in Engineering within the area of Media Technology. The focus during studies were Human Computer Interaction, Vizualisation and User Experience. During these years I have done projects involving Agile Development, Interaction Design, User centered studies and combining new technologies for innovative ways to interact.
        	<br><br>
 			Don't hesitate to <a href="#contact" class="smooth-goto">contact me</a> if you want to know more about me!
        	<br><br>

    	<h3>Swedish Railways (SJ) - My train design<br>________</h3>
    	<p>#: UX Design, Wireframing, Usability testing, Sketch, Prototyping, Android</p>
    	<p>My train is an application used by the Train inspectors to check travellers tickets, look up current train situations, current bookings and a lot more. 
    	<br><br>
    	This project was an initiative to re-design their current application that was a Hybrid web-application into a Native solution. The goal was to take advantage of native system speed, native components and familiar UX and UI to create an Application that listened to the workers needs and wants into a neat package of a new Android App.
    	<br><br>
    	User feedback on the app: <i>"The app just beceoms better and better. Super convenient ticket inspection from the last updates. Goes alot smoother and quicker now. Very well done! ❤"</i>

    	<h3>Mad Sand - AR 2 player Game<br>________</h3>
    	<p>#: Unity, Kinect, Augmented Reality, C# programming, Interaction Design</p>
    	<p>Mad Sand is a game taking augmented reality gaming to a new level, allowing you to shape a digital world in real time through a physical sandbox. The game is an asymmetric cooperative game, where one player (“the Sandmaker") shapes the sand landscape to help the other player (“the Penguin”) to collect sweets. Sweets can appear floating high up in the sky or deep beneath the earth, thus the Sandmaker must change the landscape so that the Penguin successfully can grab the sweets. To help the Sandmaker see what's going on an augmented reality experience is also provided through a projection of the game world onto the sand. <br><br>This project was a part of the Advanced graphics and interaction 2015 course at KTH.</p>

    	<h3>Snickers Workwear -  Kneepad sensor<br>________</h3>
    	<p>#: UX Design, Wireframing, Prototyping, Sketch, iOS, Bluetooth sensors, Wearable technology</p>
    	<p>Snickers Workwear excel in making world class knee pads for workers within their business. The project consisted of creating a mobile application with the help of a kneepad sensor that was to be attached close to the knee. With the help of the sensor the application could gather information on, how many times the user has bent the knee, amount of time on knees as well as temperature and sound levels. <br><br>The goal was experimenting with new technology, being in the forefront to don't lag behind and to add value to their current line of products. </p>

    	<h3>Other Room - Browser WebGL graphics<br>________</h3>
    	<p>#: WebGL, Three.js, HTML, CSS</p>
    	<p>Other Room purpose was to build a meditative scene that users could project on a wall at home to create the illusion of a another room just beyond the wall. To avoid creating a stressing experience the interaction would consist only of sound, the scene slightly changing depending on the current volume. Thus the user could put on their favorite harmonic music and watch the assets of the other room sway to the gentle music. <br><br>This project was a part of the Advanced graphics and interaction 2015 course at KTH.</p>

    	<p>Rayman meets darks souls meets grim fandango basically. Ex-Terminator with an AI mounted into just the head on a robot teddy bear body by his creator when opposed. The chip in Teddy’s head stops him from attacking the creator. Teddy’s quest is to remove the chip, regain his free will, destroy his creator and escape the lab he’s bound to.<br><br> In this project my team position was in models and animation. Deadly Teddy was the main project in the course Computer Game Design 2015 at KTH.</p>

    	<h3>Building Blocks - Physical interaction<br>________</h3>
    	<p>#: Arduino, Sensors, pySerial, Interaction Design</p>
    	<p>We wanted to create toys with physical interaction for children 1-4 years old. Building blocks have long been a robust toy for children with little evolvement for so many years, so we decided to make an alternate version of them. To inspire creativity and curiousness the blocks will change colors depending on the height of the tower the children are building. To achieve each block has a multicolor LED and Bluetooth buit in, together with a pressure sensor and pySerial server this magic was possible. <br><br> This project was part of the Physical Interaction course 2015 at KTH.</p>
